# Transportation Data Discovery, Evaluation, Compilation, Analysis, and Publication

The Office of Spatial Analysis and Visualization is automating the publication of transportation data. Specifically, OSAV will employ computer learning and artificial intelligence to automate the identification, collection, evaluation, compilation, and publication of transportation data. The activities include, but are not limited to, analyzing, designing, developing, implementing, and maintaining computer programs that:
- Identify and collect data from the Internet
- The data collected will include, but not be not limited to:
  - transportation safety across all modes and intermodally;
  - the state of good repair of United States transportation infrastructure;
  - the extent, connectivity, and condition of the transportation system
  - economic efficiency across the entire transportation sector;
  - the effects of the transportation system on global and domestic economic competitiveness;
  - demographic, economic, and other variables influencing travel behavior, including choice of transportation mode and goods movement;
  - transportation-related variables that influence the domestic economy and global competitiveness;
  - economic costs and impacts for passenger travel and freight movement;
  - intermodal and multimodal passenger movement;
  - intermodal and multimodal freight movement; and
  - consequences of transportation for the human and natural environment;
  
- Identify, store, and track the transportation data authorities responsible for publishing the data
- Identify, store, and track the Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) at which valid transportation source data exist
- Evaluate the data collected
- Compile the data collected
- Publish the data collected
- Provide metrics on the success or failure of data identification, collection, evaluation, compilation, and publication
